What is Gradle?
	tool which can do build - pack - test - doc
	From gradle
	For Project which is in Groovy
				     ---> JAVA
	For Java
	Package mgmt system
	dependecny mgt

Why we need a gradle?
	Build / CI Automation
	Ant is a Declarative - and Not can not define a process..-- TOOO MANY LINES ARE NEEDED
	Maven is a Procedudral - ONLY Follow a defined process ---- less lines of code than Ant.

	- need to decalre + defined process
	- less code  - more understanding
